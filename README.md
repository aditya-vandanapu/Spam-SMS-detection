# 📧 Spam SMS Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect spam messages using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. It classifies SMS messages as either **Spam (1)** or **Ham (0)** based on textual features. The model is trained using the **Naïve Bayes algorithm** and **TF-IDF vectorization**.

## 🎯 Task Objectives
✔ **Preprocess text messages** by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and eliminating numbers.  
✔ **Extract features** using **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical format.  
✔ **Train a Machine Learning Model** using the **Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm**.  
✔ **Evaluate model performance** using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.  
✔ **Visualize important spam words** to understand which words contribute most to classification.
